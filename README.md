  Hello world, Here i have wrote some useful snippets to get your most OFTEN code blocks easier. Hope this will help you to get the snippets on the fly.
 
# How to import all code snippets to Xcode

All Xcode code snippets exist as a .plist files in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/ You can simply copy all code snippets (.codesnippet) into this folder, restart Xcode and you should have all of them ready to use.  

Note: Create the folder if it doesn't exist already. It is created by Xcode when user adds his first custom snippet.





Thanks \n
